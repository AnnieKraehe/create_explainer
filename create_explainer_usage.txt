Usage Instructions for create_explainer.R

This script generates a text file named 'explainer.txt' in the same folder as your output file. The file includes metadata about the R session and the script that created the output, such as:

- R version
- Date the script was run
- Script name and file path
- A list of loaded packages with their versions

It must be called *after* plot_path has been defined. plot_path should contain the full file path of the output file (e.g., a saved plot or data file).

ðŸ’¡ Usage

If plot_path is defined inside a loop or function:
You need to make plot_path accessible to the global environment before calling the script:

assign("plot_path", plot_path, envir = .GlobalEnv)
source("C:/github/create_explainer/create_explainer.R")

If plot_path is already defined in the global environment:
You can just call:

source("C:/github/create_explainer/create_explainer.R")

The explainer.txt file will be created in the same directory as the file referenced in plot_path.
